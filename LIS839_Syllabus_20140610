Overview
Description
This project-based course focuses on issues and challenges related to born-digital curation in an archives environment. Topics covered may include archives best practices; changing information life cycle; assessment, curation and preservation in a digital environment; and outreach strategies.

Websites and social media are inherently digital. To archive web and social media requires a basic understanding of digital information (e.g., formats, processes, and information structures).

This course will combine coverage of general digital preservation issues with those specifically related to the acquisition and preservation of web and social media data. We will couple selected readings with in-person discussions, and students will work alone and in small groups to complete daily projects that introduce technical skills and reinforce intellectual concepts.

In order to establish a framework for this intensive, we will use the SAA Guidelines for College and University Archives as a reference point for core archival functions and expectations. Such guidelines and institutional frameworks separate the work of archives from that of academic digital humanities, records management, software development, or commerce, all areas where web and social media data are of great interest. Using core archival functions as guideposts, we will work through the process of developing a comprehensive archival approach to the activity of collecting web and social media content.

In order to collect content from social media websites and applications it is imperative that archivists understand the information architectures that support their use and development as well as the data systems that store and manage the underlying information. We will explore and learn to use existing tools that support access to web and social media content and we will discuss the general environment of web technologies as they exist today.

Course Objectives
Upon completion of this course students will have gained an in-depth appreciation of the challenges presented to archivists by the widespread adoption of online communication and knowledge sharing tools. Students will be knowledgeable about ways of dealing with such challenges through proper planning and strategizing and will be able to demonstrate an understanding of a variety of recommended and/or implemented methods for ensuring the preservation of web and social media data. Additionally, students will be familiar with recent and current research and literature on the preservation of digital records and they will be able to approach new and unforeseen digital records issues from a solid knowledge of concepts and principles.

Course Goal
To give students an opportunity to explore in-depth issues concerning the preservation of web and social media data by the creating organization/individual and/or its successor(s), such as an
archival program or institution.

Policies & Grading
Absence and Attendance Policy
Due to the limited length of this course, absences will not be permitted. If you believe you may need to miss a class, I kindly ask you to drop the course. Roll will be taken at the beginning of class. If you’re late, your participation score will decrease.

Academic Integrity
As an academic discipline and professional ﬁeld, library and information studies holds the legal rights of authors and artists in the highest regard and respects and protects those rights. As future LIS professionals, it is your responsibility to uphold these principles in your own work as you draw on the ideas, ﬁndings, and works of others. Using others’ ideas, ﬁndings, or works directly or indirectly in your own creative works (including papers, projects, blog posts, etc.) requires you to cite the original source. Not doing so will indicate to me that you have plagiarized the original author(s) and the assignment will receive no credit.

You should cite your sources strictly following the guidelines published in the American Psychological Association’s (APA) publication manual. If you are using a Web source in a blog post, a simple link to the source will sufﬁce. For the University’s full academic integrity policy, please see:
http://students.wisc.edu/doso/acadintegrity.html 

Grade Distribution
The grade distribution includes a general description of what a certain grade indicates of your progress. Please review the available rubrics for grading information speciﬁc to each assignment.

A
94-100
 Outstanding achievement. Student performance demonstrates full command of course materials and evinces a high 
degree of originality and/or creativity that far surpasses course expectations. 


AB
88-93
Very good achievement. Student performance demonstrates thorough knowledge of course materials and exceeds 
course expectations by completing all course requirements in a superior manner.


B
82-87
Good work. Student performance meets designated course expectations, demonstrates understanding of the course 
materials, and performs at an expected and acceptable level. A “B” is a normal grade.


BC 



77-81
Marginal work. Student performance demonstrates incomplete understanding of course materials. 
C 
72-76
Unsatisfactory work and inadequate understanding of course materials.

Late Work Policy
To ensure against being penalized for late work, contact me on or before the due date to request a later due date. If this is not done, your assignment will receive a half-grade deduction each day the assignment is late. Only the final project is applicable here. Daily reading summaries are not accepted if they are late.

Reasonable Accommodation of Disabilities
It is my desire to fully include students with disabilities in this course in such a way that maximizes their learning experiences and meets any speciﬁc needs they may have. To accomplish this goal, please communicate with me as early as possible regarding any accommodations that may need to be made in my instruction. I will do my utmost to protect your conﬁdentiality. 

Information for students with disabilities is available at the McBurney Disability Resource Center:
• Address: 1305 Linden Drive, Madison, WI 53706
• Phone: 608-263-2741
• Phone (tty): 608-263-6392
• URL: http://mcburney.wisc.edu

Time Commitment
For graduate level classes, a typical 3-credit course requires 9-10 hours of outside work per week plus the 3 hours for class each week, meaning over a term you're putting in approximately 180–195 hours. In theory for one credit you'd put in 1/3 of that. In a short format class that is not realistic. But you should plan that this class is a full-time commitment for the week. Plan your week wisely to build in time to read, study, and come refreshed to class each day.

Readings
Readings are online. There are no set textbooks. Digital preservation and web and social media archiving are fields where there is a wealth of high-quality information available on the web. These are also fields where there is tremendous change and where there are, as yet, few common understandings. These factors make it very important to keep up to date. Further readings may be advised during the course.

Student Responsibilities
Reading Summaries 
For each day, you will need to write a brief 1 page précis of one reading from the list of assigned readings for that day (of your choice), and submit it to me via email (bertram@avpreserve.com) before class. Late summaries will not be accepted. The summaries will be used as a starting point for discussions during that class day. Reading summaries consist of brief answers to the following questions, as well as two separate comments or questions you would like to bring to the attention of your classmates.
 
What is the issue addressed by the reading, and why is it important in the context of this class? 
What is the most important takeaway from the reading?
What critiques (if any) do you have for the author? 

A written précis will be limited to one page (single or double-spaced, no bigger than 12 point font, standard one-inch margins around).

Summaries will be graded on a 2 point scale, with 2 points corresponding to a good summary, 1 corresponding to a minimal summary, and 0 corresponding to a summary not turned in.  These summaries are worth a total of 30% of your final grade.

Daily Class Participation
Using a common methodology from software development, we will have an informal “stand up” session each morning at the beginning of class. Each student will deliver a brief (no more than 2 minute) reflection on something from the previous night’s reading assignments at the beginning of class. These informal round-robin discussions will be our starting point for each day. Participation is required.

Daily practicum exercises will be a large part of this class. In these practicums we will learn skills and new technologies useful for web and social media archiving. There will be no formal grades for successful use of the technologies, but there will be grades for participation and effort. Participation in these exercises is required.

Group exercises will also be a daily event in this class where we will work in pairs to accomplish specified tasks. Teamwork is central to digital collections management, especially web and social media archiving. No archivist is an island and we are constantly in need of the skills and expertise of others as we work towards accomplishing common goals. These exercises are designed to encourage teamwork and clear communication. No formal grades for successful completion of exercises will be given, but there will be grades for participation and effort. Participation in these exercises is required.

All class participation will be assessed by the instructor and will form 20% of your total grade.

Final Project
Develop a written plan for your personal web or social media archive (chose one website or social media account that you manage as the test data for this project). If you don’t have a website or a social media account, you will be free to select a website of your choice to use in this project. Think of this paper as a thought experiment more than a research paper. You are welcome to incorporate readings and other sources as support for your arguments, but you are not obliged to do so. I will expect you to work on this paper in sections each day, building up to the final product that will be due on Saturday. This paper will be worth 50% of your final grade.

In your personal, academic, or professional life you most likely manage at least one website, blog, or social media account. This project will take the skills and issues we address in this class and apply them to a real-life scenario in order to develop a collection plan for your selected set of data. Select one target data set from your life (e.g., a website you manage, a blog you write, or a social media account you use often). Building on assigned activities each day, you will turn in a paper at the end of this class that documents the reasoning behind your selection process, the data you will target, the methods you will use to acquire the selected data, the frequency with which you will collect your data, the methods you will use to document and store your data, the avenues you will provide for access to your archive, and the long-term plan you will follow to ensure no data is lost in the future.

Students will be encouraged to consider the effects of the scale of the project they propose and they will need to be realistic about what is a manageable project for an emerging social media archiving program.

The project will build in daily increments.

The purpose of this assignment is to have you consider how to apply the principles, standards, approaches, and activities discussed in this course. The report should be 7-9 pages and should be organized around the following issues:
 
Appraisal
Identify the target data you will collect
Discuss the reasoning behind your selection (why is it important to preserve this data?)
Original format of the data
Describe the categories of data that you will collect from your target site
Describe the method(s) that you will use to collect the target data
Determine and document the frequency with which you will collect the data
Metadata: how will information about the data be recorded and maintained? 
Discuss the method(s) you will use to document and store the data you collect
Preservation
Describe the approach(es) you will take to provide long term preservation to this data in order to ensure no data loss in the future, or at least to document any necessary data changes moving forward
Describe all files, if any, for which you cannot provide long term access using current standards, principles, approaches, and best practices. What will you do for those data files?
Authenticity and evidential integrity
Discuss what changes, if any, you think you may have to make in the future in order to continue to grow and preserve your archive 
Access
Determine how (and if) you will provide access to the data in your archive
Are there any other issues which are important for understanding how the project was designed and implemented 

For example, a student could decide to build his or her own personal twitter archive. If you were to select this path, how would you create an archive of all your tweets from the day you started until the day you stop using twitter? What is the anatomy of the data that you would collect? What method would you use to collect your data, and at what frequency would you collect it? How would you document your permissions information for future access? How would you plan for storage of your data? How you would plan to provide access to your archive for researchers, for yourself, or for online public consumption?

Schedule
Day 1 | June 2nd, Monday
The story of the Twitter archive at LC | Introduction to the theme

We’ll open with a quick case study, including an overview of issues associated with the establishment of a full archive for Twitter at the Library of Congress:
understanding the data model(s)
determining what is in the archive (selection)
for an ongoing business, such as twitter, how do you define a delivery frequency?
what’s the mechanism for delivering the content (how does LC make sure not to miss a single tweet?)
process for inventorying the data as delivered
understanding the legal issues associated with social data
when do you think about access and how do you do it? what are the issues you might face?

Practicum

1) Continued use of tools:

we never made a Warc file yesterday with wget: 

wget "http://www.archiveteam.org/" --mirror --warc-file="at"
http://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Wget_with_WARC_output


- HTTrack (http://www.httrack.com/page/2/ - mostly windows only), on mac os can homebrew httrack install (httrack -h gets you help and examples in terminal)
create mirror: httrack http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/
update mirror (might be very useful for reddit site) in same directory: httrack --update

- Heritrix (internet archive tool) -only for Linux really (difficult to manage on pc or mac) that’s why:

- web based options: http://archive.today/  (you can download a zip from the output - but it only goes ONE page deep)

-WARCREATE - http://warcreate.com/ (Chrome only) - will create a WARC file but no way to look at it and only goes one page deep as far as i can tell

Web Archiving Integrated Layer - WAIL - http://matkelly.com/wail/ 

2) Exploring APIs:

Lynda API tutorial available if anyone wants to do it

-Using Glyphy API: https://github.com/giphy/GiphyAPI

- Using the DPLA API - learning APIs challenge:  (Scalar API Explorer: http://scalar.usc.edu/tools/apiexplorer/ )

If you’re feeling very advanced, look at the instructions here to setup a very useful tool for grabbing Twitter feeds: 
Social Feed Manager (Dan Chudnov’s software) http://dicarve.blogspot.com/2014/04/an-relatively-easy-way-for-installing.html


- Twitter API (streaming vs rest) [maybe we demonstrate how to extract all the tweets for a given hashtag, e.g., #QR1863]

Practicum

Ingest and Data Migration challenge: 

Using checksums: create a checksum for a file. Change the file. Create another checksum for the changed version of the original file. Compare the two checksums.

md5 [filename]

Create a BagIt bag using Bagger or the BagIt library. We will create bags and dissect them in order to understand their structure. (http://sourceforge.net/projects/loc-xferutils/files/loc-bagger/2.1.3/bagger-2.1.3.zip/download)

Fixity
ls -i [filename] (get inode)

Group Activity: Discussion Questions

What does “creating durable digital objects” mean?

What does this mean: “Create appropriate metadata for digital objects for access, management, and preservation purposes.”?

How would you talk about the costs of a web-archiving or social media archiving project? Determine the costs of digitization projects and plan appropriate facilities and resources.

Final Project Steps

Spend the rest of class time thinking and writing about the following questions:

Preservation
Describe the approach(es) you will take to provide long term preservation to this data in order to ensure no data loss in the future, or at least to document any necessary data changes moving forward
Describe all files, if any, for which you cannot provide long term access using current standards, principles, approaches, and best practices. What will you do for those data files?
Authenticity and evidential integrity
Discuss what changes, if any, you think you may have to make in the future in order to continue to grow and preserve your archive 
Are there any other issues which are important for understanding how the project was designed and implemented
